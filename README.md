# Josh-Gumperz-React-Portfolio

This is my react-portfolio and the first big solo-project I've worked on since completing my bootcamp! The goal of this project was to create an easily accessible portfolio website so that anyone who wants to know more about me, the work I've done, or my contact information can easily find it. The site is live for anyone to see so go ahead and take a look!

### Prerequisites

The only thing you need in order to view the site is a device with internet connection and a browser!

## Getting Started

I've included screenshots of what the site should look like as you scroll through.

The first thing you should see upon loading up the site is the about me page, which looks like this:

here you can learn a little bit about me, why I got in to software development, how I learned what I know about software development, what my goals are, as well as some of my interests and hobbies.

You can use the easily accessible navigation links to navigate to any different page you choose.

You can can also easily navigate to the deployed sites for some of the projects I've worked on from any page using this carousel

This next page is where you will find acess to a few of my projects.

Upon hovering over a project, you will see a short description of that project, as well as 2 links, one to view the Github repository for that project, as well as one to view the deployed site.

Next, you can even directly view my resume by using the Resume navigation link

Finally, the last page is where you can send messages to me directly.
